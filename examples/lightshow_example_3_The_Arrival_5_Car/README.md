# **Running a 5-car show with cross-vehicle animations**

The light shows in this folder use the "The Arrival" music track that is the Tesla 2023 Holiday Release Light Show.
These 5 shows have been customised to show animations that are coordinated across 5 vehicles such that effects combine to make a unique, unified show.

Each vehicle should be configured to run a scheduled show. See details in the main README.md file on the home page.

The vehicles should be arranged per this illustration:

The shows can all be edited using the .xsq files in the show folder. Note that you must be using the latest version of the light show project to open the show seamlessly in xLights.

The coordinated show will also work with fewer than 5 vehicles (e.g., 3 vehicles using shows 2, 3, and 4).

### Requirements:
Running Software 2023.44.25 (2023 Holiday Release) or newer.

### Acknowledgement:
The 5-car multishow for "The Arrival" was designed by HVpad, an independent creator of custom light shows for Tesla vehicles.
HVpad's Youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HVpad/videos">https://www.youtube.com/c/HVpad/videos has great examples of other custom shows and tutorials for working with the Tesla xLights project.
